<h3>
<p>Hello, everyone! I would love to share with you some of my hobbies!</p>

<ul>
<li>Cyber Operations! I find the internet, computers, and cybersecurity very interesting. I spend a lot of my free time learning and practicing my craft.</li> <br/>
<li>Exercising! I do not think there are many things better than the feeling when I am at the gym making progress each week. I love the sport of bodybuilding and have been a fan since I discovered it watching "Pumping Iron" in highschool. Also, I love to run. I used to hate it when it was mandated during sports and during military physical training but recently I have started to fall in love with distance running.</li> <br/>
<li>Outdoors! I grew up in the great state of Alabama. Alabama has amazing scenery and wildlife. I was born into a family that hunts and fishes. My father's side of the family are incredible anglers. I learned a lot from them. As I grew up, my friends introduced me to hunting. It is a fantastic feeling to be out there in the woods.</li> <br/>
